# Shura

SDL3 test engine utilising SDL_GPU. Very barebones ATM and mostly just code from 
https://hamdy-elzanqali.medium.com/let-there-be-triangles-sdl-gpu-edition-bd82cf2ef615
to get me started. Lots of empty classes to fill in later.

Currently contains:
- A basic renderer class that creates a device, command buffer, and vertex buffer.
- A basic main class that creates a window and runs the main loop.
